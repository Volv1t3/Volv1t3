<p>
Hello Again! 
<br><br>
I'm Santiago, a currently enrolled student in the Computer Science Engineering Bachelor's program at Universidad San Francisco 
de Quito (USFQ) in Ecuador <3. As I didn't know what to write here, I decided I would list  a couple of aspects I think are interesting 
and relevant to my career.
</p>
<ul>
<code>Key Facts About Me && My Work</code>
<li><b style="color: cornflowerblue; font-weight: bold">Java Development Enthusiast</b>: I have a strong, and ever-growing, 
foudation in Java development. I tend to focus on learning industry frameworks and libraries, applying both my theoretical
computer science knowledge and their solutions to solving industry problems.</li>
<li><b style="color: cornflowerblue; font-weight: bold">Markdown Researcher</b>: I thoroughly enjoy having long and detailed
markdown documents, finding pride in having a well-thought-out and written research document about computer science topics
that interest me or study sessions I have.</li>
<li><b style="color: cornflowerblue; font-weight: bold">Eager Learner</b>: Aside from my regular coursework, I often find myself
moving ahead with challenging and thought-provoking computer science concepts that further my view of the theoretical basis
of the subject, while also opening a chance for me to work on my coding skills</li>
<li><b style="color: cornflowerblue; font-weight: bold"> Language Enthusiast</b>: I absolutely enjoy learning about new 
languages, however I often find myself out of time to learn about them as I would want. Nevertheless, I'm used to setting 
aside some time to learn a new tool or read about new developments in our field.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my spare time, I love diving into new computer science concepts, reading about the latest trends in technology, 
and working on personal projects to experiment with new ideas.

<b>I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to reach out if you would like to connect or work 
together on something exciting!</b></p>

<h2 style="color: beige; font-size: 14pt">&boxUR; Technical and Soft Skills &boxUL;  </h2>
<p>While this list is not exhaustive, and I would love to increase the size of this list in the near future, in the interest
of being honest I shall put all the technologies I know so far!</p>

<h2 style="color: beige; font-size: 14pt">&boxUR; Projects &boxUL;  </h2>
<q>Disclaimer: Given that I am still studying, my academic and personal-project balance has not been the best. Most of 
my projects so far have been class assignments or personal learning projects. I am actively working on expanding my 
portfolio with more diverse and complex projects!</q>
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, there are some projects that I think showcase that I have an eagerness to learn and apply my knowledge
to produce good code.</p>

<ul>
<li><b style="color: cornflowerblue; font-weight: bold">Rol de Pagos</b>: An application developed as part of my 
Application's Course meant to showcase the ability of JavaFX in handling employee management applications, designed to 
withstand a wide range of user behaviors and options.<br>
It leveraged good concepts and libraries from the Java EE collection, from serialization formatting to industry standard 
norms for data communication and parsing. The project was completed using JavaFX for its versatility and simplicity through
SceneBuilder for UI development.
<br>
<br>
In essense this project is an extensible, mini version, of an ERP system. I am quite proud of it!

<li><b style="color: cornflowerblue; font-weight: bold">Blackjack Game</b>: A project developed as part of my Programming Two C++ class. This application was designed to implement the game of Blackjack, showcasing my ability to work with C++ and apply object-oriented programming concepts effectively.<br>
It was built to handle various user inputs and simulate the Blackjack gameplay, including functionalities for placing bets, dealing cards, and determining game outcomes. The project stood out for its robustness and reliability among the class submissions.
<br>
<br>
The Blackjack Game project is a testament to my understanding of fundamental programming concepts and game development principles. I am very proud of this project!
